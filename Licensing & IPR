WORKING WITH AUDIO COMPONENTS

https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/working-with-audio-components-2019-3#

Unityâ€™s audio system imports most standard audio file formats. It allows one 
to mix and master in real time, and it can replicate 3D spatial sound effects like 
echo, object movement (like the sound of a fast-moving car), and reverb. 
In this file, we list the imported audio files, and add Audio Source and Audio Listener 
components to our project. 

In addition, one original laser gun sound was created by: sfxia by rxi / A tiny sound generator.
